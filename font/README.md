# README - Ubuntu font

These files are the files for the whole Ubuntu font.

In reality, only one font is used in this project: "ubuntu.regular", but I decided to provide them all just in case someone wanna change the type of Ubuntu font.

It is not using Google Fonts. And files aren't comming from it.

Actually, I downloaded them from the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/) on [this page](https://design.ubuntu.com/font).

Then I converted them using a little Python script I made to convert fonts using multiple libraries such as the [FontForge Python Binding](https://fontforge.org/docs/scripting/python.html).

Finally I wrote a little CSS file which imports these to CSS. To load the font, just load the CSS file and it'll be done.

> WARNING: The default family name for this font isn't "Ubuntu" or "ubuntu" but "ubuntu.regular" !

I release this CSS file in public-domain. I don't care about anyone to use that file. Do what the heck you want with it.

The Ubuntu font files, even converted ones, are released under the [Ubuntu Font License](https://ubuntu.com/legal/font-licence) by the [Ubuntu Project](https://ubuntu.com/).

Notice the fact that I use the same fonts and these same files in all my projects (lol).
